In this paper, the electrochemical reduction of indium on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) in a chloride elec-
trolyte in the presence of tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBACh) was studied using the rotating disk electrode
method, chronoamperometry and scanning electron microscopy. It was found that the addition of TBACh in-
hibits the electroreduction of indium by increasing the activation energy of the process by 17 kJ molÅ|1, and also
shows leveling action at its low concentrations. The diffusion coefficient of indium (III) ions found from Levich
equation at 25 ÅãC, was 4.93 Å~ 10Å|6 cm2 sÅ|1. The In3+ diffusion coefficient determined using the Levich
equation are consistent with the values determined by the Cottrell law and universal Stokes-Einstein equation.
The addition of 10Å|4 M TBACh to the electrolyte reduces the diffusion coefficient to 2.13 Å~ 10Å|6 cm2 sÅ|1.
The type of crystallization corresponding to the progressive 3D nucleation with diffusion control has been
established. Using the Scharifker-Hills, Scharifker-Mostany and Mirkin-Nilov-Heerman-Tarallo models nuclea-
tion parameters were calculated, which correlate well with the results of scanning electron microscopy. Addition
of TBACh increases the nucleation rate at Å|0.90 V from 9.19 Å~ 106 cmÅ|2 sÅ|1 to 48.09 Å~ 106 cmÅ|2 sÅ|1 and
reduces the average radius of grains of indium coatings from 18.0 É m to 6.8 É m.

1. Introduction

Electrodeposition of indium has been comprehensively investigated
on solid electrodes such as platinum, glassy carbon electrode, nickel,
tungsten, molybdenum and copper [17]. This great interest is due to
the practical application of indium, namely, the production of an ul-
trapure metal with subsequent use in the preparation of various semi-
conductor alloys. The most complete review of the electroreduction of
indium on various electrodes is given in [8,9]. Recently, in the elec-
trodeposition of indium, ionic liquids were used as an electrolyte,
which makes it possible to obtain compact coatings of indium and its
alloys [1014]. This effect is explained by the increase of the number of
active sites during electrodeposition of indium on tungsten and glassy
carbon electrodes [4]. From aqueous chloride electrolytes, high purity
indium is obtained, but forms dendritic coatings [15].
Earlier studies [16,17] have established the influence of chloride
ions on the electrocrystallization of indium on a glassy carbon elec-
trode, and the limiting stage of electrochemical reduction of indium and
the nucleation mechanism were determined. It has been established

that as the concentration of chloride ions increases, the nucleation rate
increases too.
To improve the quality of the coatings, it is necessary to add sur-
factants to the electrolyte, which have a leveling action in indium
electrodeposition. In [1821], additions of quaternary ammonium salts
were used to inhibit dendritic formation during electrodeposition of
zinc, copper and silver; these additives showed a high leveling effect.
Formation of compact coatings is possible when surfactants are added
to the electrolyte. So, in [22,23], for electrodeposition of zinc on carbon
steel (AISI 1018), additives of quaternary ammonium compounds were
used to obtain compact coatings. N-benzyltriethylammonium chloride
and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide additives inhibit the growth of
dendrites and can be used as a leveling additive, whereas in the case of
tetraethylammonium hydroxide this effect is negligible [24].
In this paper, we studied the electroreduction of indium on a glassy
carbon electrode in the presence of tetrabutylammonium chloride
(TBACh) using a rotating disk electrode and chronoamperometry. In
addition, the kinetics of the initial stages of electrocrystallization and
local deposition of fragments of a new solid phase has been studied.

Calculations for the study of nucleation were carried out using three-
dimensional nucleation models of Scharifker-Hills, Scharifker-Mostany
and Mirkin-Nilov-Heerman-Tarallo. The theoretical calculations used in
this work are described in detail in the works of the above authors
[2529].
2. Experimental

All electrochemical experiments were carried out in a conventional
three-electrode electrochemical cell
in a volume of 100 mL using
Autolab PGSTAT 302 N and Bio-Logic VSP 300 potentiostat/galva-
nostats. A platinum plate (an indium plate in case of long-term chron-
oamperometry) and an Ag/AgCl (Metrohm) were used as the counter
and reference electrodes, respectively. The working electrode was GCE
produced by Metrohm with the geometric area of about 0.07 cm2.
A 2 M NaCl solution containing 0.05 M InCl3 with pH 1.5 was used
as a blank solution. Tetrabutylammonium chloride with different con-
centrations was then added into blank solution. InCl3 (Sigma Aldrich,
99.99%) and TBACh (Sigma Aldrich, 99.99%) were used without fur-
ther purification. The experiments were performed with variation of the
temperature, overpotential and rotation speed. The scan rate was
10 mV sÅ|1. Before each measurement the working electrode was po-
lished and rinsed with distilled water. From the voltammetric study,
reduction potentials for chronoamperometric experiments were chosen
in order to study the mechanism of nucleation from current transient
and then obtain bulk indium deposits with longer deposition times. The
chronoamperometric measurements at 35Åã were chosen because of the
optimal temperature of electrochemical refining of indium which is
~40 ÅãC. Voltammetric researches were then conducted in a temperature
range of 2555 ÅãC.
The electrical double layer impedance was measured using an
Autolab PGSTAT 302 N potentiostat/galvanostat with a FRA 32 M
module at the potential of Å|1.0 V in the frequency range of 100 kHz to
210 Hz at the amplitude of 10 and the system was calibrated using a
standard equivalent cell produced by Metrohm. Impedance measure-
ments were carried out in 2 M NaCl solutions (pH 1.5) without and with
1 Å~ 10Å|4 M of TBACh. The interpretation of the experimental data of
impedance measurements was carried out using the FrumkinMelik-
Gaikazyan (FMG) circuit, which is presented in the work of Laes [30] on
the kinetics of tetrabutylammonium ion adsorption on a Bi(011) plane.
A good correlation was obtained between the experimental data and
their fitting using this circuit. Criteria for estimating the correlation
were such parameters as the É‘2 - Chi-square function and É¢2 - weighted
sum of squares.
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM Philips XL-30 FEG) was used to
study the morphology of the indium deposits.

overvoltage

The currenttime curves of indium electroreduction from the fol-
lowing aqueous acidic chloride solutions with and without TBACh at
the cathodic potential E = Å|0.95 V are shown in Fig. 1. At this po-
tential, all current can be attributed to indium deposition, given the
high
indium
(j0 = 8 Å~ 10Å|12 A cmÅ|2) [31].
Fig. 1 shows the limiting diffusion current at small times (1500 s) of
the It curve. It can be seen from Fig. 1 (curves 1,3) that at large times
(30007500 s), there is a significant increase in the cathodic deposition
current of indium for the blank electrolyte and blank solution with 10Å|3 M
TBACh (from about 7.2 to 20.1 mA). Since any rise in cathodic current
during a potentiostatic electrodeposition is assumed to be due to an in-
crease in true electrode surface area, the variation in current versus time at
constant applied potential reflects the change in surface morphology
(roughness, often dendritic growth) with a high sensitivity [18]. Thus, in

on

this manner, the efficiency of morphology-controlling additive and its
concentration can be readily assessed by their effect on the current [32].
The addition of 10Å|4 M TBACh in the electrolyte of electrodeposition
produces flat currenttime responses (curve 2). If the concentration of
TBACh increases 10-fold, no effect is observed (curve 3). Visual observa-
tion of the sample in blank solution after the experiment showed needle -
shaped dendritic indium. Same observations were made for samples ob-
tained in the presence of 10Å|3 M TBACh deposits. But with addition of
10Å|4 M TBACh in the electrolyte, the current remains constant, indicating
the inhibitory effect on formation of dendrites during indium electro-
deposition. This is also confirmed by visual observation.
To explain the inhibitory effect of TBACh on the process of dendritic
formation during electrodeposition of indium, the kinetics of electro-
reduction and phase-formation of indium on a GCE was studied.
Electroreduction of indium from chloride solutions can be re-
presented as follows:

Fig. 2 shows cyclic voltammograms of the discharge-ionization of
indium on a glassy carbon electrode from a chloride electrolyte of the
following composition 0.05 M InCl3 + 2 M NaCl. The reduction starts
at E = Å|0.76 V with an increase in cathodic current, followed by a
limiting diffusion current at Å|0.83 V.
Varying the speed of rotation of the disk electrode allows estab-
lishing the limiting stage of the electrode process. The values of the
limiting cathode currents grow with the increasing rotation speed. The
growth of the area of the anode peak at different rotation rates is ex-
plained by the increase in the mass of the deposited indium. To de-
termine the diffusion coefficient of In3+ ions, the dependence of the
limiting cathode currents (jl.c.) on the square root of the angular velo-
city of rotation (É÷1/2) was used. The diffusion coefficient of In3+ ions
was calculated using Levich equation on the basis of the dependence of
the limiting cathode currents (jl. c) on the square root of the angular
velocity of rotation (É÷1/2) (Fig. 2. Inset) It was found that the rate-
determining stage of the electroreduction of indium on a glassy carbon
electrode is diffusion.
The above presented dependence (Fig. 2. Inset) is characterized by a
high correlation coefficient (in all cases R2 > 0.99), which makes it
possible to calculate the diffusion coefficient of In3+ ions at different
temperatures (Table 1). As the temperature increases, an increase in the
limiting cathode currents is observed (Fig. 3), which is associated with
an increase in the diffusion coefficient (DIn3+), obeying the Arrhenius
equation (Fig. 3. Inset).
The effect of TBACh on the discharge-ionization of indium is shown
in Fig. 4(A). Adsorption of surfactants on the surface of the electrode
can change the rate of electrode reactions within wide limits. In this
case, the slowdown is most often observed. One can see a significant
decrease in the cathodic currents in the presence of the additive, and a
decrease in the slope angle of the jE curve is observed at the anode
branch of the cyclic voltammogram, which is associated with an in-
crease in the polarization resistance. Without TBACh it is observed that
the limiting diffusion current is the same for reverse and forward course
of the voltammogram. But addition of TBACh shows a significant dif-
ference between the forward and reverse course. This difference could
be due to the different adsorption of tetrabutylammonium ions on the
glassy carbon electrode and on the surface covered with indium. One
can see the decrease in the rate of the process in the region of high
surface coverages of glassy carbon electrode with adsorbate (more ne-
gative than Å|1.1 V) and the influence of surface nature on limiting
cathode current is insignificant. The difference in the cathodic current
density in the potential range from Å|0.64 V to Å|0.9 V in both cases
(curve 1 and curve 2) is related to the nucleation overpotential. The
given dependence (Ågcurrent crossoverÅh) is typical for the processes of
3D electrodeposition of metals. In addition, the observed shift in the
potential of the initiation of deposition (En is the nucleation potential) is
indium
due to the inhibition of

the electroreduction process of

(Fig. 4A). Adsorption, which is preferable at fractures, blocks them,
which leads to a reduction in the number of growth sites and the for-
mation of new nuclei and clusters on a flat surface regardless of the
existing steps [33].

The adsorption of TBACh on the surface of the glassy carbon elec-
trode is confirmed by impedance measurements (Fig. 4(B)). The im-
pedance spectroscopy diagrams are shown in Fig. 4(B). The data have
been perfectly fitted using a FrumkinMelik-Gaykazyan circuit, where
Rel and Cdl are respectively the resistance of solution and the double
layer capacitance and W is the Warburg element that describes the
diffusion of species. According to classical models, this circuit includes
an additional capacitance (Cad) related to adsorption of surfactant.
From the figure (Fig. 4(B) inset), a significant reduction of the
double layer capacitance is observed in electrolyte containing TBACh.
This indicates clearly the adsorption of TBACh on the electrode surface
in the range of the electrodeposition potentials of indium. With a
TBACh concentration of 10Å|4 M, the capacitance is ~7.4 É F cmÅ|2.
B.B. Damaskin and al [34], also studied the adsorption behavior of
tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI) on polycrystalline indium in a so-
lution of Na2SO4. They pointed out from the capacitance measurements
that with an addition of 10Å|3 M TBAI, the double layer capacitance is
~10 É F cmÅ|2. This decrease of the double layer capacitance means a
decrease in the surface charge of the electrode and an inhibition of the
process. In this case, adsorbed molecules or ions can directly participate

in all stages of the electrode process, including charge transfer. The
influence of adsorbate is described by the amount of adsorbed ions
coverage  É∆. This function f(É∆) describes not only the partial blocking
of the surface by the adsorbate, but also the overcoming of the addi-
tional potential barrier É¢G(É∆) by the depolarizer, which includes a
quantity reflecting interactions in the adsorbed layer such as the brid-
ging effect. In addition, the above function describes the change in the
É’Åf  potential in the presence of adsorbed ions.
In our case, the electroreduction of In occurs via the electron bridge
mechanism as a result of adsorption of chloride ions on indium ad-
atoms and the further interaction of these ions with [InCl2(H2O)n]+
ions from the solution. The electron bridge mechanism of indium
electroreduction was investigated by A.G. Munoz, S.B. Saidman and
J.B. Bessone in the work [16]. The change in the surface of the glassy
carbon electrode on the reverse course of the current-voltage curve
leads to the appearance above-mentioned effect and to a change in the
surface coverage (É∆). This apparently explains the difference in the
limiting diffusion current of indium electroreduction in the forward and
reverse course of the potential scan (Fig. 4A, curve 2).
Similarly, it can be seen from Fig. 4(A) that in the presence of the
TBA+ ion, with decreasing potential, the cathode current density de-
creases gradually, and at a potential of Å|1.2 V it approaches zero. This
effect can be explained by the surface coverage (É∆) by adsorbed TBA+
ions. Shifting the potential into the negative region can increase É∆ and

the repulsive interaction energy between the [N(C4H9)4]+ and [In
(H2O)n]3+ ions, thereby inhibiting the electrode process. From the lit-
erature [35,36] it is known that the change in the free energy of the
repulsive interaction depends nonlinearly on the surface coverage, and
it increases sharply at É∆ > 0.6. The nature of the interaction of ad-
sorbed TBA+ ions and the depolarizer is very complex, and deserves
special study.
Analogous voltammetric measurements and calculations have been
performed for the determination DIn3+ in the presence of TBACh. Fig. 5
shows the CVA at different temperatures and the rotation speed of the
electrode.
To assess the correctness of the determination of the diffusion
coefficient of indium ions under the investigated conditions by the RDE
method, the universal Stokes-Einstein equation was used, which is ap-
plicable both for organic and for aqueous media.

It is known from [3739] that in aqueous solutions, the hydrated
3+ has a regular octahedral shape and a radius of
indium ion - In(H2O)6
21.4 nm. The values  of the dynamic viscosity of the solution were
taken from the literature [40]. The possibility of applying the Stokes-
Einstein model to calculate the theoretical radius of indium ions from
the experimentally determined values of the diffusion coefficient is
shown in [41]. The values of the diffusion coefficient of In3+, calcu-
lated from Eq. (1) and experimentally found, and the activation energy
(Ea) are presented in Table 1.
The is a slight difference in the calculated and experimentally de-
termined values which could be due to the lack of consideration of the
solvation process and various interactions in solution with the participa-
tion of background electrolyte components, in obtaining the calculated
values of the diffusion coefficient. Similar results were obtained by
Andrew P. Abbott and his colleagues in [42]. Taking into account all of the
above, as well as the simplified nature of the model, it can be noted that
the difference in the values of the indium ion diffusion coefficient, cal-
culated and experimentally determined, is entirely permissible.
To confirm the reliability of the values DIn3+ obtained by the RDE
method, we found the diffusion coefficient of In3+ ions at 35 ÅãC from
chronoamperometric measurements based on the Cottrell equation. Its
numerical value was 6.35 Å~ 10Å|6 cm2 sÅ|1, which agrees well with the
result obtained by the RDE method (6.14 Å~ 10Å|6 cm2 sÅ|1).
Thus, it is established from the results obtained that the electro-
reduction of indium on a glassy carbon electrode proceeds in a diffusion
mode. The addition of 10Å|4 M TBACh leads to a shift in the potential of
the onset of indium deposition into the region of negative potentials

calculated from the current maxima of the potentiostatic transients,
according to the well-known equations [29]. In the SH model, the es-
timation of the nucleation parameters is based only on one point (tmax
and jmax). For a more accurate assessment of the kinetic parameters of
indium crystallization on glassy carbon, more appropriate models have
been used, such as the Scharifker-Mostany (SM) model and the Mirkin-
Nilov-Heerman-Tarallo (MNHT) model. According to the literature
[43], the accuracy of the SM model depends on the time interval, and
this model well describes theoretical dependence of j vs. t just in the
limit of a longer time. The MNHT model includes a correction to the SM
model for short periods of time. The values of the stationary nucleation
rate, obtained by fitting the theoretically calculated jct curve (Fig. 8)
using the SM and MNHT models are presented in Table 2.
As can be seen from Table 2 and Fig. 9, in case of indium electro-
deposition on a glassy carbon electrode as the polarization increases,
the stationary nucleation rate and the saturation nucleus density in-
crease. At a potential of Å|0.7 V in a blank electrolyte, the stationary
nucleation
was
1.25 Å~ 104 cmÅ|2 sÅ|1, and at a potential of Å|0.95 V the nucleation rate
is 2.76 Å~ 107 cmÅ|2 sÅ|1. This effect is enhanced in the presence of
tetrabutylammonium additives. Thus, at a potential of Å|0.95 V in the
presence
from
2.76 Å~ 107 cmÅ|2 sÅ|1 to 1.05 Å~ 108 cmÅ|2 sÅ|1. From the values Nsat
found the average radius of grains of electrodeposited indium was
calculated from Eq. (7) in [4] (Fig. 9).
Increase in overvoltage significantly reduces the average radius
grains of the cathode deposit in the absence of TBACh. With an increase
in the overvoltage from 60 mV to 310 mV, the average grain radius
decreases from 65.2 É m to 9.5 É m, respectively. Additions of tetra-
butylammonium even with small overvoltages lead to the formation of
finely dispersed deposits of indium. At overvoltage of 310 mV in the
presence of TBACh, a deposit with a grain size of 5.7 É m is formed. In
the presence of 10Å|4 M TBACh in the electrolyte, the difference in the
grain size with increasing overvoltage decreases.
To confirm these calculations, the morphology of indium coatings
obtained in an electrolyte containing 10Å|4 M TBACh was observed by
Scanning Electron Microscopy (Fig. 10), and EDX analysis results are
shown in inset. For each deposit, EDX analysis confirmed the presence
of indium metal on the glassy carbon substrate.
The comparison of the morphology of indium coatings in electro-
lytes with and without tetrabutylammonium chloride shows that in
presence of additive, the grains have a smaller radius. This is in good
agreement with the previously calculated average radii of grains and
confirms the leveling effect of TBACh, leading to the formation of dense
and uniform coatings.

3.2. Nucleation studies

In order to determine the kinetic parameters of electrocrystallization
and the type of nucleation, potentiostatic transients for the electro-
deposition of indium on GC electrode in 0.05 M InCl3 containing solutions
were obtained. It can be seen from the chronoamperograms that, at a
potential of Å|0.65 V, indium electrodeposition is not observed (Fig. 6A,
B). At a potential of Å|0.70 V, electroreduction of In3+ ions occurs and the
current maxima are observed (jmax = Å|6.3 mA cmÅ|2; tmax = 10.61 s),
which is associated with the overlapping of the diffusion zones of in-
dividual crystallites and hemispherical mass-transfer gives way to linear
mass-transfer to a effectively planar surface. The further course of the
current transients is explained by the diffusion limitation. Additions of
tetrabutylammonium to deposition electrolyte significantly shift
the
chronoamperogram maxima to the region of small times (tmax = 0.93 s;
jmax = Å|23.3 mA cmÅ|2).
The shape of the experimental potentiostatic transients in the non-
dimensional coordinates ((j/jmax)2t/tmax) depends on the nature of the
rate-determining stage and the type of nucleation. In the case of dif-
fusion-controlled processes, the approach to analyzing the above tran-
sients has been developed by B.R. Scharifker and G.J. Hills.
Experimental transients are compared in Fig. 7A, B to transients cal-
culated according to the Scharifker-Hills (SH) model for instantaneous
and progressive three-dimensional nucleation.
The experimental curves obtained without tetrabutylammonium
chloride are in good agreement with a 3D progressive nucleation
(Fig. 7A). Same type of nucleation has been pointed out with TBACh
additives.

established that small additions of tetrabutylammonium in the elec-
trolyte cause a leveling effect.
The diffusive nature of the rate-determining stage of electroreduc-
tion of indium on a glassy carbon electrode from chloride electrolytes
by the method of a rotating disk electrode has been established. The
diffusion coefficient of In3+ ions was determined in chloride electro-
lytes with and without TBACh. In an electrolyte containing 10Å|4 M
TBACh, the diffusion coefficient decrease and the activation energy of
the process increases by 17 kJ molÅ|1, indicating an inhibition of the
electrode process.
The experimentally determined diffusion coefficient is in agreement
with that theoretically calculated from Stokes-Einstein equations.
From chronoamperometric measurements a three-dimensional pro-
gressing nucleation with diffusion control has been established, in
agreement
tetra-
butylammonium increases the nucleation rate and the saturation den-
sity of the number of active centers. This leads to a decrease in the
average grain radius of electrodeposited indium at an overvoltage of
310 mV in 10Å|4 M TBACh electrolyte, from 12.5 É m to 5.7 É m. The
results of SEM analysis confirm the formation of compact coatings of
indium.
